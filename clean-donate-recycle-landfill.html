      Clean → Donate → Recycle → Landfill (Last)
    </h1>

    <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-white/80">
      Junk removal shouldn’t end at the landfill.
      At VetsToTheRescue, we believe customers deserve to know exactly what happens
      to their items once they’re hauled away.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      Many companies take everything straight to the dump because it’s faster.
      We take a more intentional approach—one that prioritizes reuse, community impact,
      and responsible disposal.

      Step 1: Cleaning and Preparing Furniture for Donation
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      When we remove furniture, the first question we ask is simple:
      <strong>Can this item still help someone?</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      If an item is structurally sound and in usable condition, our team takes
      the time to clean and prepare it properly. That means wiping down surfaces,
      removing debris, and separating donation-ready pieces from items that
      aren’t suitable.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      This extra step ensures donated items are ready for immediate use—not dropped
      off in a condition that creates more work for the organization receiving them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-black mt-12">
      Supporting the Denver Rescue Mission
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      When furniture qualifies, we prioritize donating it to the
      <strong>Denver Rescue Mission</strong>.
      Their programs support individuals and families experiencing homelessness
      through emergency shelter, recovery services, and transitional housing.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      Donated furniture helps furnish living spaces where people are rebuilding
      their lives. A couch, table, or bed frame that might have been discarded
      instead becomes part of someone’s fresh start.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-black mt-12">
      Step 2: Recycling What Can’t Be Donated
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      Not every item can be donated—but that doesn’t mean it belongs in a landfill.
      Whenever possible, we separate materials for recycling.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      Common recyclable materials include metal, appliances, cardboard, electronics,
      and certain wood components. Sorting and recycling these materials keeps
      reusable resources in circulation and reduces unnecessary landfill waste.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-black mt-12">
      Step 3: Landfill Is the Last Resort
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      Only after an item cannot be donated or recycled do we take it to the landfill.
      This step is intentional—not automatic.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      Some items are damaged, contaminated, or unsafe to reuse.
      When that’s the case, proper disposal is the responsible choice.
      The key difference is that landfill use is minimized by design.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-black mt-12">
      Why This Process Matters
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      Junk removal decisions have real impact. When usable items are discarded,
      communities lose resources and landfills fill faster.
      A thoughtful process creates better outcomes for everyone.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-white/80">
      Our approach reflects a belief in accountability, care, and doing the job right—
      values that guide how we treat our customers, their belongings, and the community.
    </p>

        Got a problem? One call. It’s gone.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-white/80">
        And when it’s gone, you can feel good knowing it was handled the right way.
